Foreground Simulation for 21 cm Reionization Signal Detection
=============================================================

The ``fg21sim`` is a low-frequency radio foregrounds simulator
aiming to provide the simulation of the common foregrounds
impeding the 21 cm reionization signal detection. 

The simulated foregrounds can be used to evaluate the impacts of
different foreground components on the EoR signal, and can be also
used to help develop and test various foreground removal methods.

Status
--------
We are working on the next-gen simulation suite `Fg21Sim+ <https://github.com/Fg21Sim/Fg21SimPlus>`_
, which offers higher resolution, better fidelity, and, eventually,
a full sky coverage for all the foreground components. Future updates
will be added to the next-gen suite.

Demo Papers
--------
Here are papers using the `fg21sim` to simulate the foregrounds:

* Lian,+ 2020: `Contribution of Galactic free-free emission to the foreground for EoR signal in SKA experiments <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1232L>`_;

* Li,+ 2019: `Contribution of Radio Halos to the Foreground for SKA EoR Experiments <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...879..104L>`_;

* Li,+ 2019: `Separating the EoR signal with a convolutional denoising autoencoder: a deep-learning-based method <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.2628L>`_;

Features
--------
* Supported foreground components:

  + ``galactic/synchrotron``:
    Galactic synchrotron emission
    (*Note:* only the *unpolarized* part considered)
  + ``galactic/freefree``:
    Galactic free-free emission
  + ``galactic/snr``:
    Emission from Galactic supernovae remnants (SNRs)
  + ``extragalactic/clusters``:
    Emission from extragalactic galaxy clusters
    (*Note:* only giant radio halos, the modeling of which is elaborated
    in our paper:
    `2019, ApJ, 879, 104 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab21bc>`_;
    `ADS:2019ApJ...879..104L <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...879..104L>`_;
    `arXiv:1905.05399 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05399>`_)

* High-resolution simulation within sky patches
* Fine-grained control with various configuration options
* Modular and extensible
* Clean code
* Command line utilities


Installation
------------
1. Install the required software and libraries:

   * `CFITSIO <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html>`_
   * `HEALPix <http://healpix.sourceforge.net/>`_:
     only the C++ library required by
     `healpy <https://github.com/healpy/healpy>`_.
   * `LLVM <http://llvm.org/>`_:
     (required by `llvmlite <http://llvmlite.pydata.org/>`_ that is
     further required by `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_)

2. Clone this repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Fg21Sim/fg21sim

3. Install the required third-party Python packages.
   And it is recommended to use the `virtual environment`_::

    $ cd fg21sim/
    $ make venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $

   Check to make sure that this virtual environment is activated so that the
   ``python3`` and ``pip3`` are pointed to the virtual environment.

4. Install this software into the virtual environment::

    (venv) $ python3 setup.py install

5. You are ready to use this software.  Just have a look, e.g.::

    (venv) $ fg21sim --help


Development
-----------
To ease the development, install this package in the **editable state**::

    $ cd fg21sim/
    $ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
    $ pip3 install --editable .

In addition, setting the environment variable ``DEBUG_FG21SIM`` forces
this software to run at the ``DEBUG`` logging level.
